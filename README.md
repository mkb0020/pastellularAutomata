# 🌈 Pastellular Automata

**Emergence, but make it pretty.**

Pastellular Automata is a playful, interactive cellular automata simulator built in JavaScript and HTML Canvas.  
It’s designed as a learning tool, a visual experiment, and a cozy sandbox for exploring how simple rules can generate surprisingly complex behavior.

This project is part educational curiosity, part aesthetic experiment — and part “what happens if I poke the universe right here?”

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Pastel rainbow cells that age over time
- 🧬 Conway-style cellular automata rules
- 👆 In-canvas interaction (tap/click to start & stop)
- 📱 Responsive layout (mobile + desktop)
- 🖼️ Canvas-based rendering (no libraries)

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

Cellular automata are discrete systems made of simple cells that follow local rules.  
Despite their simplicity, they can produce patterns that feel alive, chaotic, or even… meaningful 👀

Pastellular Automata exists to:
- Learn by building
- Experiment visually
- Explore emergence without intimidation
- Make math-adjacent things feel *soft*

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Click / Tap Canvas** → Start or pause the simulation
- **Reset** → Refresh the page (for now!)
- Cells evolve automatically once running

*(More interaction tools coming soon 👀)*

## 🚧 Roadmap Ideas

- Click-to-paint cells
- Speed & chaos sliders
- Save / load patterns
- Wolfram class visualization
- 1D and 3D automata modes

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Love for emergence ✨
